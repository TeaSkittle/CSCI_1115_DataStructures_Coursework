# Functional style in Java

- Use final on all variables ( makes them constant/non-changing )
- Use ternary operators where possible, make them expressions and not statements
  - [ Nested Ternary ]( http://twistedoakstudios.com/blog/Post5273_how-to-read-nested-ternary-operators )
- Try and avoid void methods, make them return a value if possible
- Use recursion in place of loops where possible
- Always have else following an if
