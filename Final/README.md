# Final

## Overview

This final project is a TUI-based personal habit tracker based utilizing a HashMap for the database. It is 
titled "66 Days", based off of the average time it takes to develop a new habit ( https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-happiness-project/200910/stop-expecting-change-your-habit-in-21-days ). In the "Habits/" folder I have included a few example habits.
